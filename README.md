# Multivariate-regression
Multivariate Regression is a method used to measure the degree at which more than one independent variable (predictors) and more than one dependent variable (responses), are linearly related. The method is broadly used to predict the behavior of the response variables associated to changes in the predictor variables, once a desired degree of relation has been established.
